# kidney_disease_prediction

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) refers to disorders affecting kidney’s structure and function.
It is a worldwide health crisis that affect 8-10% of the population . Early detection can
stop or slow the progression of the kidney disease by referring patients to preventive and
early intervention treatments.
UCI Machine Learning Repository has a dataset that contains 25 attributes that can be used to
predict CKD two months earlier

So as part of the CPIS490 - Big Data course at king Abdulaziz university 
We used our knowledge from this course to apply 3 different classification algorithms to predict whether the
person will develop a CKD or not. 

using : 
1-Regression method
2-Naïve Bayes
3-Decision Trees

The result shows the logistic regression model is the best with AUC 98%


And now we have the experience to use the knowledge i had from this course to apply it
to any real-world problem.
